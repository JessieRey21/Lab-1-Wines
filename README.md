In class lab for DATA3444 on predicting wine types using kNN algorithm

Lab Description: You will be exploring a dataset that will be used for wine recognition based on numerical features obtained through a chemical analysis.
The features include fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chorides, free and total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, 
and quality rating. You will be using these features to build a ML classifier that can predict the type of wine (red or white).
